This Code should enable you run basic nufft functions easily

The directory contains 4 folders:
1) extern - fortran files implement nufft functions
2) lib - python and matlab modules used by functions in programs
3) tests - tests and benchmarks for functions in programs
4) programs - nufft functions can be run from command line

tests
-----
1) to run all tests run the following command:
python -m unittest discover (-v to verbose)
2) to run all benchmarks run the following command:
python -m nufft_benchmark -- this can take a while...

programs
-----
you can run the following commands from shell:
1) ./rand_rots.py (n, output) - random n rotation matrices and save them to output
2) ./generate_random_volumes.py (n, output) - random volume n x n x n and save to output
3) ./vol_project.py (vol, rots, output) - project vol with rots and save to output
4) ./update_nufft.sh (n) - compile the fortran nufft function and creates an pyf module
the function in module can be called from any python module. To determine input of every
function, you need to change manually the relevant pyf files, for example, if you want to change
the function nufft1d1f90 you need search for this function in nufft1df90.f, see the relevant
parameters and change them in nufft1df90.pyf. Notice that you can also determine the type of
each variable in the input and the output and you can add/change some basic checks on them.
